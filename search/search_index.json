chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

                                                 A molecular genetic technique that isolates and sequences chromosomal regions that are rich in open chromatin. First, nuclei are harvested from a cellular sample. Then a hyperactive Tn5 transposase is added to the nuclei where it excises non-nucleosomal DNA strands and ligates co-administered high-throughput sequencing adapters (tagmentation).  The tagged DNA fragments are isolated, amplified by PCR and sequenced. The number of reads for specific region of DNA correlate with increased chromatin accessibility and this method can identify regions of transcription factor and nucleosome binding.

Amplicon Sequencing                                                A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Bisulfite Sequencing                                               A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

It is assumed that these proteins are related to the function of the target antigen at the cellular level.

Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation High-throughput Sequencing       A molecular biology method combining crosslinking-immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing techniques to detect and map RNA-protein interactions. In CLIP, whole tissues, organisms or individual cell types are treated with UV irradiation, which introduces covalent bonds between RNA-protein complexes. This is followed by immunoprecipitation and removal of the protein component of the crosslinked complex.

DRIP-seq                                                           A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Dynamic Light Scattering                                           A type of spectroscopy that utilizes a laser beam to irradiate a sample containing particles in suspension, resulting in light scattering. Rapid fluctuations in scattering intensity, around a mean value at a certain angle, occur because of particle diffusion and are dependent upon on particle size. The calculated correlation function yields a diffusion coefficient, for a given temperature and viscosity, which can be used to calculate particle size.

HL-Chip                                                            A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Immunohistochemistry Staining Method                               Immunohistochemical staining techniques allow for the visualization of antigens via the sequential application of a specific antibody to the antigen (primary antibody), a secondary antibody to the primary antibody and an enzyme complex with a chromogenic substrate. The enzymatic activation of the chromogen results in a visible reaction product at the antigen site. The specimen may then be counterstained and coverslipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope and aid in the differential diagnosis of pathophysiological processes, which may or may not be associated with a particular antigen.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Mint-ChIP                                                          A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing.

It is the underlying principle of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Optical Coherence Tomography                                       Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) combines the principles of ultrasound with the imaging performance of a microscope. OCT uses infrared light waves that reflect off the internal microstructure within the biological tissues. The frequencies and bandwidths of infrared light are orders of magnitude higher than medical ultrasound signals, resulting in greatly increased image resolution, 8-25 times greater than any existing modality. In addition to providing high-level resolutions for the evaluation of microanatomic structures OCT is also able to provide information regarding tissue composition.

A sample is prepared and then exposed to primary antibodies raised in different species recognizing the target epitopes on the proteins of interest. Then, secondary antibodies that are tagged with short oligonucleotides and that target each primary antibody are added. Next, a mixture comprised of a ligase, PCR components and a connector oligonucleotide, which hybridizes to both oligonucleotide tags and can prime rolling DNA circle synthesis, are added and the sample is subjected to real-time PCR to amplify the DNA circles. Rolling circle synthesis and amplification is only possible if the protein epitopes are in close proximity (i.e. in a protein complex). Finally, a labeled complementary nucleotide probe is added to detect and/or visualize the amplified DNA.

RAS Protein Family Activation Assay                                An in vitro assay that can indirectly detect the activation of small GTPases in the RAS family through the staining of phosphorylated forms of MEK (MAP2K) family proteins (pMEK). A farnesylated RAS family protein is anchored to an in vitro model of the plasma membrane and, under different conditions, is co-incubated with both a RAF family protein, which binds to and is activated by active RAS proteins, and a MEK family protein, which is phosphorylated by active RAF proteins. pMEK is detected using a donor bead coated with anti-MEK antibodies that is capable of oxidizing an acceptor molecule attached to an anti-pMEK antibody. When the donor and acceptor are in close proximity, the acceptor molecule is oxidized and can be visualized using electron microscopy.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing.

Arises from the low probability absorption of quanta with a higher energy than that required for a transition: the difference in energy is emitted as a lower frequency (energy) photon.

Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing                        A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Single-Cell Barcode Chip                                           A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TCR Sequencing                                                     A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Thermal Shift Assay                                                A molecular biology technique used to detect the interaction of a DNA binding protein with its cognate binding sequence.  Labeled DNAs were reacted with crude cell extracts and the complexes are run through a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel.  The migration of the labeled DNA through the gel will be slower by being bound.  This shift in electrophoretic mobility indicates functional binding between the protein and the DNA.

Suspended Microchannel Resonator                                   Particles are weighed in real-time with the suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) as they flow through a hollow cantilever. In addition to weighing particles with femtogram precision, the SMR can also measure mass density with a resolution of 10-4 g/mL. This is possible since the microchannel resonant frequency is determined by the difference in mass of the particle with respect to that of the displaced fluid. Thus, the particle's density is determined by measuring its mass in two fluids of different densities. The SMR can measure the growth of single cells as well as the absorption of biomolecules to microchannel walls. Scaling the current SMR design by ten-fold will result in a thousand-fold improvement in mass resolution (attogram) and thereby enable single viruses to be weighed with high precision.

Pancreas                             An organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is the shape of a fish and about the size of a hand. It is a compound gland composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues. The endocrine pancreas makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for energy. The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known. Pelvic Lymph Nodes                   Any lymph node within the pelvic region.

It is composed of cells with a large eccentric nucleus, prominent nucleolus, and abundant cytoplasm. Mutations of the SMARCB1 gene or very rarely SMARCA4 (BRG1) gene are present. The vast majority of cases occur in childhood. Symptoms include lethargy, vomiting, cranial nerve palsy, headache, and hemiplegia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia                                                    The most frequent type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Approximately 75% of cases occur in children under six years of age.  This is a good prognosis leukemia.  In the pediatric age group the complete remission rate is approximately 95% and the disease free survival rate is 70%.  Approximately 80% of children appear to be cured.  In the adult age group the complete remission rate is 60-85%.

It includes the most frequently seen morphologic variants which are: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Barrett Esophagus                                                                 Esophageal lesion lined with columnar metaplastic epithelium which is flat or villiform. Barrett epithelium is characterized by two different types of cells: goblet cells and columnar cells. The symptomatology of Barrett esophagus is that of gastro-esophageal reflux. It is the precursor of most esophageal adenocarcinomas.

The basal cell neoplastic proliferation in the epidermis results in basal cell carcinomas.  The basal cell neoplastic proliferation in the salivary glands can be benign, resulting in basal cell adenomas or malignant, resulting in basal cell adenocarcinomas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Basal-Like Breast Carcinoma                                                       A biologic subset of breast carcinoma defined by high expression of genes characteristic of basal epithelial cells, including KRT5 and KRT17, annexin 8, CX3CL1, and TRIM29, and usually by lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It is the most common subtype of breast cancer associated with BRCA1 mutations, and is associated with a poor prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Biliary Tract Carcinoma                                                           A carcinoma arising from the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, cystic duct, or gallbladder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bladder Carcinoma                                                                 Cancer that forms in tissues of the bladder (the organ that stores urine). Most bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas (cancer that begins in cells that normally make up the inner lining of the bladder). Other types include squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in thin, flat cells) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). The cells that form squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma develop in the inner lining of the bladder as a result of chronic irritation and inflammation.

Cervical Carcinoma                                                                Cancer that forms in tissues of the cervix (the organ connecting the uterus and vagina). It is usually a slow-growing cancer that may not have symptoms but can be found with regular Pap tests (a procedure in which cells are scraped from the cervix and looked at under a microscope). Cervical cancer is almost always caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

Cancer that forms where the right and left ducts meet is called Klatskin tumor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Chondroblastoma                                                                   A benign, chondroid-producing, well-circumscribed, lytic neoplasm usually arising from the epiphysis of long bones.  It is characterized by the presence of chondroblasts, osteoclast-like giant cells, chondroid formation, calcification, and mitotic activity. In aggressive cases, there is rearrangement of the 8q21 chromosome band.  It occurs most frequently in children and young adults and rarely metastasizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Choriocarcinoma                                                                   An aggressive malignant tumor arising from trophoblastic cells. The vast majority of cases arise in the uterus and represent gestational choriocarcinomas that derive from placental trophoblastic cells. Approximately half of the cases develop from a complete hydatidiform mole. A minority of cases arise in the testis or the ovaries. There is often marked elevation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood. Choriocarcinomas disseminate rapidly through the hematogenous route; the lungs are most frequently affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia                                                      The most common type of chronic lymphoid leukemia.  It comprises 90% of chronic lymphoid leukemias in the United States.  Morphologically, the neoplastic cells are small, round B-lymphocytes.  This type of leukemia is not considered to be curable with available therapy.

Representative examples of benign neoplasms include lipoma and leiomyoma.  Representative examples of malignant neoplasms include carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma.  Colorectal adenomas always exhibit epithelial dysplasia and are considered premalignant neoplasms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Combined Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma                          A rare tumor containing unequivocal elements of both hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma that are intimately admixed.  This tumor should be distinguished from separate hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma arising in the same liver.  The prognosis of this tumor is poor.

Other symptoms include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. There are several subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ                                                   A noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, ductal carcinoma in situ may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues, although it is not known at this time how to predict which lesions will become invasive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Neoplasm                                         A neoplasm of the nervous system that arises from the neuroepithelial tissues.  Representative examples include astrocytic tumors, oligodendroglial tumors, ependymal tumors, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Endometrial Carcinoma                                                             Cancer that forms in the tissue lining the uterus (the small, hollow, pear-shaped organ in a woman's pelvis in which a fetus develops). Most endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Endometrial Neoplasm                                                              A benign, borderline, or malignant neoplasm that affects the endometrium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Ependymoma                                                                        A type of brain tumor that begins in cells lining the spinal cord central canal (fluid-filled space down the center) or the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces of the brain). Ependymomas may also form in the choroid plexus (tissue in the ventricles that makes cerebrospinal fluid).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Esophageal Adenocarcinoma                                                         A malignant tumor with glandular differentiation arising predominantly from Barrett mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus.  Rare examples of esophageal adenocarcinoma deriving from ectopic gastric mucosa in the upper esophagus have also been reported.  Grossly, esophageal adenocarcinomas are similar to esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.  Microscopically, adenocarcinomas arising in the setting of Barrett esophagus are typically papillary and/or tubular.  The prognosis is poor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Esophageal Carcinoma                                                              Cancer that forms in tissues lining the esophagus (the muscular tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach). Two types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in flat cells lining the esophagus) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                A squamous cell carcinoma arising from the esophagus.  It is associated with a long history of tobacco and alcohol abuse and is exceedingly rare before the age of 30.  The median age is around 65 in both males and females.  It is located mostly in the middle and lower third of the esophagus.  Grossly, polypoid, ulcerated, plaque-like and occult lesions have been described.  The microscopic features are the same as in other squamous cell carcinomas.  Any degree of differentiation may occur, and variation within a single tumor is common.  The prognosis is poor.

Gallbladder Carcinoma                                                             Cancer that forms in tissues of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ below the liver that collects and stores bile (a fluid made by the liver to digest fat). Gallbladder cancer begins in the innermost layer of tissue and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gastric Adenocarcinoma                                                            An adenocarcinoma arising from the stomach glandular epithelium. Gastric adenocarcinoma is primarily a disease of older individuals.  It most commonly develops after a long period of atrophic gastritis and is strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. The lack of early symptoms often delays the diagnosis of gastric cancer. The majority of patients present with advanced tumors which have poor rates of curability. Microscopically, two important histologic types of gastric adenocarcinoma are recognized: the intestinal and diffuse type. The overall prognosis of gastric adenocarcinomas is poor, even in patients who receive a \"curative\" resection (adapted from Sternberg's Surgical Pathology, 3rd ed., 1999).

The category of adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction also includes the majority of adenocarcinomas previously called gastric cardia adenocarcinomas.  Squamous cell carcinomas that affect or cross the junction of the stomach and esophagus are classified as carcinomas of the distal esophagus.  Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction occurs more often in Caucasian middle aged and elderly males.  Clinical signs and symptoms include dysphagia, abdominal pain, and weight loss.  The prognosis depends on the completeness of the surgical resection, the number of lymph nodes involved by cancer, and the presence or absence of postoperative complications.  The presence of TP53 mutations indicates worse prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Gastrointestinal Stromal Neoplasm                                                 A type of tumor that usually begins in cells in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract.

This subtype of breast cancer is associated with a good prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Lung Adenocarcinoma                                                               A carcinoma that arises from the lung and is characterized by the presence of malignant glandular epithelial cells.  There is a male predilection with a male to female ratio of 2:1.  Usually lung adenocarcinoma is asymptomatic and is identified through screening studies or as an incidental radiologic finding.  If clinical symptoms are present they include shortness of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and fever.  Tobacco smoke is a known risk factor.

Lung Small Cell Carcinoma                                                         An aggressive (fast-growing) cancer that forms in tissues of the lung and can spread to other parts of the body. The cancer cells look small and oval-shaped when looked at under a microscope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                      A carcinoma arising from squamous bronchial epithelial cells. It may be keratinizing or non-keratinizing. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the presence of keratinization, pearl formation, and/or intercellular bridges. Non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the absence of keratinization, pearl formation, and intercellular bridges. Cigarette smoking and arsenic exposure are strongly associated with squamous cell lung carcinoma.

Lymphoma                                                                          Cancer that begins in cells of the immune system. There are two basic categories of lymphomas. One kind is Hodgkin lymphoma, which is marked by the presence of a type of cell called the Reed-Sternberg cell. The other category is non-Hodgkin lymphomas, which includes a large, diverse group of cancers of immune system cells. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas can be further divided into cancers that have an indolent (slow-growing) course and those that have an aggressive (fast-growing) course. These subtypes behave and respond to treatment differently. Both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas can occur in children and adults, and prognosis and treatment depend on the stage and the type of cancer.

Representative examples include carcinoma and lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor                                           An uncommon, highly aggressive malignant tumor, arising from the peripheral nerves and affecting mostly adults in their third to sixth decades of life.  It usually occurs in medium-sized and large nerves of the buttock, thigh, upper arm, or the paraspinal region.  It may be associated with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Malignant Peritoneal Neoplasm                                                     Cancer of the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Malignant Skin Neoplasm                                                           Cancer that forms in the tissues of the skin. There are several types of skin cancer. Skin cancer that forms in melanocytes (skin cells that make pigment) is called melanoma. Skin cancer that forms in the lower part of the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) is called basal cell carcinoma. Skin cancer that forms in squamous cells (flat cells that form the surface of the skin) is called squamous cell carcinoma. Skin cancer that forms in neuroendocrine cells (cells that release hormones in response to signals from the nervous system) is called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Most skin cancers form in older people on parts of the body exposed to the sun or in people who have weakened immune systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mantle Cell Lymphoma                                                              An aggressive, usually diffuse non-Hodgkin lymphoma composed of small to medium sized B-lymphocytes (centrocytes).  Most patients present with advanced stage disease with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow involvement.  The gastrointestinal tract is the most commonly affected extranodal site by this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  The vast majority of cases express the t(11;14)(q13;q32) resulting in the rearrangement of the BCL-1 gene and the overexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Marginal Zone Lymphoma                                                            An indolent (slow-growing) type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins forming in certain areas (the marginal zones) of lymph tissue. There are three types based on whether it forms in the spleen, lymph nodes, or other lymphoid tissue that contains a lot of B cells (a type of white blood cell).

Melanoma                                                                          A malignant, usually aggressive tumor composed of atypical, neoplastic melanocytes. Most often, melanomas arise in the skin (cutaneous melanomas) and include the following histologic subtypes: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma. Cutaneous melanomas may arise from acquired or congenital melanocytic or dysplastic nevi. Melanomas may also arise in other anatomic sites including the gastrointestinal system, eye, urinary tract, and reproductive system. Melanomas frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and brain.

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma                                                  An infiltrating adenocarcinoma that arises from the epithelial cells of the pancreas.  It affects males more often than females and the patients are usually over 50 years of age.  Microscopically it is characterized by the presence of glandular (ductal) differentiation and desmoplastic stroma formation.  Signs and symptoms include pain, loss of weight, and jaundice.  It grows rapidly and is usually detected after it has metastasized to other anatomic sites.  The prognosis is usually poor.

The tumor can be hormonally functioning or not. It has a low frequency of metastatic spread. When metastatic, the term metastatic pituitary neuroendocrine tumor is endorsed instead of pituitary carcinoma.

It usually arises from the skin or subcutaneous tissues in the extremities, trunk, and head and neck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia                                           The most frequent type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Approximately 75% of cases occur in children under six years of age.  This is a good prognosis leukemia.  In the pediatric age group the complete remission rate is approximately 95% and the disease free survival rate is 70%.  Approximately 80% of children appear to be cured.  In the adult age group the complete remission rate is 60-85%.

They should be differentiated from secondary involvement of the nervous system in systemic lymphomas. The incidence of primary CNS lymphomas has recently increased markedly worldwide from about 1% to over 6% of primary intracranial neoplasms due mainly as a consequence of the AIDS epidemic.  Primary CNS lymphomas affect all ages, with a peak incidence in immunocompetent subjects during the sixth and seventh decade of life and a male:female ratio of 3:2. In immunocompromised patients, the age at manifestation is lowest in individuals who have an inherited immunodeficiency (10 years), followed by transplant recipients (37 years) and AIDS patients (39 years, 90% males). About 60% of primary CNS lymphomas involve the supratentorial space, including the frontal (15%), temporal (8%), parietal (7%) and occipital (3%) lobes, basal ganglia/periventricular regions (10%) and corpus callosum (5%), the posterior fossa (13%), and the spinal cord (1%).  The majority of primary CNS lymphomas are large B-cell lymphomas, often associated with the Epstein-Barr virus.  (Adapted from WHO.) Primary Myelofibrosis                                                             A progressive, chronic disease in which the bone marrow is replaced by fibrous tissue and blood is made in organs such as the liver and the spleen, instead of in the bone marrow. This disease is marked by an enlarged spleen and progressive anemia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Prostate Adenocarcinoma                                                           An adenocarcinoma arising from the prostate gland.  It is one of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men.  The majority of adenocarcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occurs in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland.  Grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma predicts disease progression and correlates with survival.  Several grading systems have been proposed, of which the Gleason system is the most commonly used.  Gleason sums of 2 to 4 represent well-differentiated disease, 5 to 7 moderately differentiated disease and 8 to 10 poorly differentiated disease.  Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Treatment options include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen ablation and cryotherapy.  Watchful waiting or surveillance alone is an option for older patients with low-grade or low-stage disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Prostate Carcinoma                                                                One of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men.  The majority of carcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occur in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland.  Grossly, prostatic carcinomas appear as ill-defined yellow areas of discoloration in the prostate gland lobes.  Adenocarcinomas represent the overwhelming majority of prostatic carcinomas.  Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic carcinoma.

Salivary Gland Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma                                           An adenoid cystic carcinoma arising from the salivary gland.  It is characterized by the presence of epithelial and myoepithelial cells forming tubular, cribriform, and solid patterns.  It usually presents as a slow growing mass.  Patients may experience pain because of the tumor propensity for perineural invasion.  The tumor may follow an aggressive clinical course with recurrences and mestastases to distant sites including lungs, bones, brain, and liver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Sarcoma                                                                           A usually aggressive malignant neoplasm of the soft tissue or bone. It arises from muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. Sarcomas occur in both children and adults. The prognosis depends largely on the degree of differentiation (grade) of the neoplasm. Representative subtypes are liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Schwannoma                                                                        A tumor of the peripheral nervous system that arises in the nerve sheath (protective covering).  It is almost always benign, but rare malignant schwannomas have been reported.

Sinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                 A rare, keratinizing or non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma arising from the mucosal epithelium of the nasal cavity or the paranasal sinuses.  It affects most often the maxillary sinus.  Less frequently, it arises from the nasal cavity, ethmoid sinus, sphenoid sinus, and frontal sinus.  Symptoms include nasal fullness, epistaxis, rhinorhea, pain, and paresthesia.  Patients with nasal squamous cell carcinoma usually present earlier than patients with maxillary sinus carcinoma and have a better prognosis compared to the latter group.

Teratoma                                                                          A type of germ cell tumor that may contain several different types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, and bone.  Teratomas occur most often in the ovaries in women, the testicles in men, and the tailbone in children.  Not all teratomas are malignant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Testicular Embryonal Carcinoma                                                    A malignant germ cell neoplasm arising from the testis.  It is composed of primitive epithelial cells arranged in solid, papillary, and glandular configurations.  Most patients present with a testicular mass, which may be associated with pain.  More than half of the patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis.  The form of treatment following radical orchiectomy is stage dependent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Thyroid Gland Anaplastic Carcinoma                                                An aggressive carcinoma of the thyroid gland composed of undifferentiated cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Thyroid Gland Carcinoma                                                           Cancer that forms in the thyroid gland (an organ at the base of the throat that makes hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and weight). Four main types of thyroid cancer are papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. The four types are based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Thyroid Gland Noninvasive Follicular Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear FeaturesA non-invasive neoplasm of thyroid follicular cells with a follicular growth pattern and nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma that has an extremely low malignant potential. These tumors were formerly classified as non-invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma or well-differentiated tumor of uncertain malignant potential.

immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

                                                 A molecular genetic technique that isolates and sequences chromosomal regions that are rich in open chromatin. First, nuclei are harvested from a cellular sample. Then a hyperactive Tn5 transposase is added to the nuclei where it excises non-nucleosomal DNA strands and ligates co-administered high-throughput sequencing adapters (tagmentation).  The tagged DNA fragments are isolated, amplified by PCR and sequenced. The number of reads for specific region of DNA correlate with increased chromatin accessibility and this method can identify regions of transcription factor and nucleosome binding.

Amplicon Sequencing                                                A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Bisulfite Sequencing                                               A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

It is assumed that these proteins are related to the function of the target antigen at the cellular level.

Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation High-throughput Sequencing       A molecular biology method combining crosslinking-immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing techniques to detect and map RNA-protein interactions. In CLIP, whole tissues, organisms or individual cell types are treated with UV irradiation, which introduces covalent bonds between RNA-protein complexes. This is followed by immunoprecipitation and removal of the protein component of the crosslinked complex.

DRIP-seq                                                           A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Dynamic Light Scattering                                           A type of spectroscopy that utilizes a laser beam to irradiate a sample containing particles in suspension, resulting in light scattering. Rapid fluctuations in scattering intensity, around a mean value at a certain angle, occur because of particle diffusion and are dependent upon on particle size. The calculated correlation function yields a diffusion coefficient, for a given temperature and viscosity, which can be used to calculate particle size.

HL-Chip                                                            A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Immunohistochemistry Staining Method                               Immunohistochemical staining techniques allow for the visualization of antigens via the sequential application of a specific antibody to the antigen (primary antibody), a secondary antibody to the primary antibody and an enzyme complex with a chromogenic substrate. The enzymatic activation of the chromogen results in a visible reaction product at the antigen site. The specimen may then be counterstained and coverslipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope and aid in the differential diagnosis of pathophysiological processes, which may or may not be associated with a particular antigen.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Mint-ChIP                                                          A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing.

It is the underlying principle of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Optical Coherence Tomography                                       Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) combines the principles of ultrasound with the imaging performance of a microscope. OCT uses infrared light waves that reflect off the internal microstructure within the biological tissues. The frequencies and bandwidths of infrared light are orders of magnitude higher than medical ultrasound signals, resulting in greatly increased image resolution, 8-25 times greater than any existing modality. In addition to providing high-level resolutions for the evaluation of microanatomic structures OCT is also able to provide information regarding tissue composition.

A sample is prepared and then exposed to primary antibodies raised in different species recognizing the target epitopes on the proteins of interest. Then, secondary antibodies that are tagged with short oligonucleotides and that target each primary antibody are added. Next, a mixture comprised of a ligase, PCR components and a connector oligonucleotide, which hybridizes to both oligonucleotide tags and can prime rolling DNA circle synthesis, are added and the sample is subjected to real-time PCR to amplify the DNA circles. Rolling circle synthesis and amplification is only possible if the protein epitopes are in close proximity (i.e. in a protein complex). Finally, a labeled complementary nucleotide probe is added to detect and/or visualize the amplified DNA.

RAS Protein Family Activation Assay                                An in vitro assay that can indirectly detect the activation of small GTPases in the RAS family through the staining of phosphorylated forms of MEK (MAP2K) family proteins (pMEK). A farnesylated RAS family protein is anchored to an in vitro model of the plasma membrane and, under different conditions, is co-incubated with both a RAF family protein, which binds to and is activated by active RAS proteins, and a MEK family protein, which is phosphorylated by active RAF proteins. pMEK is detected using a donor bead coated with anti-MEK antibodies that is capable of oxidizing an acceptor molecule attached to an anti-pMEK antibody. When the donor and acceptor are in close proximity, the acceptor molecule is oxidized and can be visualized using electron microscopy.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing.

Arises from the low probability absorption of quanta with a higher energy than that required for a transition: the difference in energy is emitted as a lower frequency (energy) photon.

Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing                        A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Single-Cell Barcode Chip                                           A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TCR Sequencing                                                     A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Thermal Shift Assay                                                A molecular biology technique used to detect the interaction of a DNA binding protein with its cognate binding sequence.  Labeled DNAs were reacted with crude cell extracts and the complexes are run through a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel.  The migration of the labeled DNA through the gel will be slower by being bound.  This shift in electrophoretic mobility indicates functional binding between the protein and the DNA.

Suspended Microchannel Resonator                                   Particles are weighed in real-time with the suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) as they flow through a hollow cantilever. In addition to weighing particles with femtogram precision, the SMR can also measure mass density with a resolution of 10-4 g/mL. This is possible since the microchannel resonant frequency is determined by the difference in mass of the particle with respect to that of the displaced fluid. Thus, the particle's density is determined by measuring its mass in two fluids of different densities. The SMR can measure the growth of single cells as well as the absorption of biomolecules to microchannel walls. Scaling the current SMR design by ten-fold will result in a thousand-fold improvement in mass resolution (attogram) and thereby enable single viruses to be weighed with high precision.

It is composed of cells with a large eccentric nucleus, prominent nucleolus, and abundant cytoplasm. Mutations of the SMARCB1 gene or very rarely SMARCA4 (BRG1) gene are present. The vast majority of cases occur in childhood. Symptoms include lethargy, vomiting, cranial nerve palsy, headache, and hemiplegia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia                                                    The most frequent type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Approximately 75% of cases occur in children under six years of age.  This is a good prognosis leukemia.  In the pediatric age group the complete remission rate is approximately 95% and the disease free survival rate is 70%.  Approximately 80% of children appear to be cured.  In the adult age group the complete remission rate is 60-85%.

It includes the most frequently seen morphologic variants which are: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Barrett Esophagus                                                                 Esophageal lesion lined with columnar metaplastic epithelium which is flat or villiform. Barrett epithelium is characterized by two different types of cells: goblet cells and columnar cells. The symptomatology of Barrett esophagus is that of gastro-esophageal reflux. It is the precursor of most esophageal adenocarcinomas.

The basal cell neoplastic proliferation in the epidermis results in basal cell carcinomas.  The basal cell neoplastic proliferation in the salivary glands can be benign, resulting in basal cell adenomas or malignant, resulting in basal cell adenocarcinomas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Basal-Like Breast Carcinoma                                                       A biologic subset of breast carcinoma defined by high expression of genes characteristic of basal epithelial cells, including KRT5 and KRT17, annexin 8, CX3CL1, and TRIM29, and usually by lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It is the most common subtype of breast cancer associated with BRCA1 mutations, and is associated with a poor prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Biliary Tract Carcinoma                                                           A carcinoma arising from the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, cystic duct, or gallbladder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bladder Carcinoma                                                                 Cancer that forms in tissues of the bladder (the organ that stores urine). Most bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas (cancer that begins in cells that normally make up the inner lining of the bladder). Other types include squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in thin, flat cells) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). The cells that form squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma develop in the inner lining of the bladder as a result of chronic irritation and inflammation.

Cervical Carcinoma                                                                Cancer that forms in tissues of the cervix (the organ connecting the uterus and vagina). It is usually a slow-growing cancer that may not have symptoms but can be found with regular Pap tests (a procedure in which cells are scraped from the cervix and looked at under a microscope). Cervical cancer is almost always caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

Cancer that forms where the right and left ducts meet is called Klatskin tumor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Chondroblastoma                                                                   A benign, chondroid-producing, well-circumscribed, lytic neoplasm usually arising from the epiphysis of long bones.  It is characterized by the presence of chondroblasts, osteoclast-like giant cells, chondroid formation, calcification, and mitotic activity. In aggressive cases, there is rearrangement of the 8q21 chromosome band.  It occurs most frequently in children and young adults and rarely metastasizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Choriocarcinoma                                                                   An aggressive malignant tumor arising from trophoblastic cells. The vast majority of cases arise in the uterus and represent gestational choriocarcinomas that derive from placental trophoblastic cells. Approximately half of the cases develop from a complete hydatidiform mole. A minority of cases arise in the testis or the ovaries. There is often marked elevation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood. Choriocarcinomas disseminate rapidly through the hematogenous route; the lungs are most frequently affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia                                                      The most common type of chronic lymphoid leukemia.  It comprises 90% of chronic lymphoid leukemias in the United States.  Morphologically, the neoplastic cells are small, round B-lymphocytes.  This type of leukemia is not considered to be curable with available therapy.

Representative examples of benign neoplasms include lipoma and leiomyoma.  Representative examples of malignant neoplasms include carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma.  Colorectal adenomas always exhibit epithelial dysplasia and are considered premalignant neoplasms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Combined Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma                          A rare tumor containing unequivocal elements of both hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma that are intimately admixed.  This tumor should be distinguished from separate hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma arising in the same liver.  The prognosis of this tumor is poor.

Other symptoms include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. There are several subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ                                                   A noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, ductal carcinoma in situ may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues, although it is not known at this time how to predict which lesions will become invasive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Neoplasm                                         A neoplasm of the nervous system that arises from the neuroepithelial tissues.  Representative examples include astrocytic tumors, oligodendroglial tumors, ependymal tumors, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Endometrial Carcinoma                                                             Cancer that forms in the tissue lining the uterus (the small, hollow, pear-shaped organ in a woman's pelvis in which a fetus develops). Most endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Endometrial Neoplasm                                                              A benign, borderline, or malignant neoplasm that affects the endometrium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Ependymoma                                                                        A type of brain tumor that begins in cells lining the spinal cord central canal (fluid-filled space down the center) or the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces of the brain). Ependymomas may also form in the choroid plexus (tissue in the ventricles that makes cerebrospinal fluid).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Esophageal Adenocarcinoma                                                         A malignant tumor with glandular differentiation arising predominantly from Barrett mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus.  Rare examples of esophageal adenocarcinoma deriving from ectopic gastric mucosa in the upper esophagus have also been reported.  Grossly, esophageal adenocarcinomas are similar to esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.  Microscopically, adenocarcinomas arising in the setting of Barrett esophagus are typically papillary and/or tubular.  The prognosis is poor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Esophageal Carcinoma                                                              Cancer that forms in tissues lining the esophagus (the muscular tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach). Two types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in flat cells lining the esophagus) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                A squamous cell carcinoma arising from the esophagus.  It is associated with a long history of tobacco and alcohol abuse and is exceedingly rare before the age of 30.  The median age is around 65 in both males and females.  It is located mostly in the middle and lower third of the esophagus.  Grossly, polypoid, ulcerated, plaque-like and occult lesions have been described.  The microscopic features are the same as in other squamous cell carcinomas.  Any degree of differentiation may occur, and variation within a single tumor is common.  The prognosis is poor.

Gallbladder Carcinoma                                                             Cancer that forms in tissues of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ below the liver that collects and stores bile (a fluid made by the liver to digest fat). Gallbladder cancer begins in the innermost layer of tissue and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gastric Adenocarcinoma                                                            An adenocarcinoma arising from the stomach glandular epithelium. Gastric adenocarcinoma is primarily a disease of older individuals.  It most commonly develops after a long period of atrophic gastritis and is strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. The lack of early symptoms often delays the diagnosis of gastric cancer. The majority of patients present with advanced tumors which have poor rates of curability. Microscopically, two important histologic types of gastric adenocarcinoma are recognized: the intestinal and diffuse type. The overall prognosis of gastric adenocarcinomas is poor, even in patients who receive a \"curative\" resection (adapted from Sternberg's Surgical Pathology, 3rd ed., 1999).

The category of adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction also includes the majority of adenocarcinomas previously called gastric cardia adenocarcinomas.  Squamous cell carcinomas that affect or cross the junction of the stomach and esophagus are classified as carcinomas of the distal esophagus.  Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction occurs more often in Caucasian middle aged and elderly males.  Clinical signs and symptoms include dysphagia, abdominal pain, and weight loss.  The prognosis depends on the completeness of the surgical resection, the number of lymph nodes involved by cancer, and the presence or absence of postoperative complications.  The presence of TP53 mutations indicates worse prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Gastrointestinal Stromal Neoplasm                                                 A type of tumor that usually begins in cells in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract.

This subtype of breast cancer is associated with a good prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Lung Adenocarcinoma                                                               A carcinoma that arises from the lung and is characterized by the presence of malignant glandular epithelial cells.  There is a male predilection with a male to female ratio of 2:1.  Usually lung adenocarcinoma is asymptomatic and is identified through screening studies or as an incidental radiologic finding.  If clinical symptoms are present they include shortness of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and fever.  Tobacco smoke is a known risk factor.

Lung Small Cell Carcinoma                                                         An aggressive (fast-growing) cancer that forms in tissues of the lung and can spread to other parts of the body. The cancer cells look small and oval-shaped when looked at under a microscope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                      A carcinoma arising from squamous bronchial epithelial cells. It may be keratinizing or non-keratinizing. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the presence of keratinization, pearl formation, and/or intercellular bridges. Non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the absence of keratinization, pearl formation, and intercellular bridges. Cigarette smoking and arsenic exposure are strongly associated with squamous cell lung carcinoma.

Lymphoma                                                                          Cancer that begins in cells of the immune system. There are two basic categories of lymphomas. One kind is Hodgkin lymphoma, which is marked by the presence of a type of cell called the Reed-Sternberg cell. The other category is non-Hodgkin lymphomas, which includes a large, diverse group of cancers of immune system cells. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas can be further divided into cancers that have an indolent (slow-growing) course and those that have an aggressive (fast-growing) course. These subtypes behave and respond to treatment differently. Both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas can occur in children and adults, and prognosis and treatment depend on the stage and the type of cancer.

Representative examples include carcinoma and lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor                                           An uncommon, highly aggressive malignant tumor, arising from the peripheral nerves and affecting mostly adults in their third to sixth decades of life.  It usually occurs in medium-sized and large nerves of the buttock, thigh, upper arm, or the paraspinal region.  It may be associated with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Malignant Peritoneal Neoplasm                                                     Cancer of the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Malignant Skin Neoplasm                                                           Cancer that forms in the tissues of the skin. There are several types of skin cancer. Skin cancer that forms in melanocytes (skin cells that make pigment) is called melanoma. Skin cancer that forms in the lower part of the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) is called basal cell carcinoma. Skin cancer that forms in squamous cells (flat cells that form the surface of the skin) is called squamous cell carcinoma. Skin cancer that forms in neuroendocrine cells (cells that release hormones in response to signals from the nervous system) is called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Most skin cancers form in older people on parts of the body exposed to the sun or in people who have weakened immune systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mantle Cell Lymphoma                                                              An aggressive, usually diffuse non-Hodgkin lymphoma composed of small to medium sized B-lymphocytes (centrocytes).  Most patients present with advanced stage disease with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow involvement.  The gastrointestinal tract is the most commonly affected extranodal site by this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  The vast majority of cases express the t(11;14)(q13;q32) resulting in the rearrangement of the BCL-1 gene and the overexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Marginal Zone Lymphoma                                                            An indolent (slow-growing) type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins forming in certain areas (the marginal zones) of lymph tissue. There are three types based on whether it forms in the spleen, lymph nodes, or other lymphoid tissue that contains a lot of B cells (a type of white blood cell).

Melanoma                                                                          A malignant, usually aggressive tumor composed of atypical, neoplastic melanocytes. Most often, melanomas arise in the skin (cutaneous melanomas) and include the following histologic subtypes: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma. Cutaneous melanomas may arise from acquired or congenital melanocytic or dysplastic nevi. Melanomas may also arise in other anatomic sites including the gastrointestinal system, eye, urinary tract, and reproductive system. Melanomas frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and brain.

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma                                                  An infiltrating adenocarcinoma that arises from the epithelial cells of the pancreas.  It affects males more often than females and the patients are usually over 50 years of age.  Microscopically it is characterized by the presence of glandular (ductal) differentiation and desmoplastic stroma formation.  Signs and symptoms include pain, loss of weight, and jaundice.  It grows rapidly and is usually detected after it has metastasized to other anatomic sites.  The prognosis is usually poor.

The tumor can be hormonally functioning or not. It has a low frequency of metastatic spread. When metastatic, the term metastatic pituitary neuroendocrine tumor is endorsed instead of pituitary carcinoma.

It usually arises from the skin or subcutaneous tissues in the extremities, trunk, and head and neck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia                                           The most frequent type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Approximately 75% of cases occur in children under six years of age.  This is a good prognosis leukemia.  In the pediatric age group the complete remission rate is approximately 95% and the disease free survival rate is 70%.  Approximately 80% of children appear to be cured.  In the adult age group the complete remission rate is 60-85%.

They should be differentiated from secondary involvement of the nervous system in systemic lymphomas. The incidence of primary CNS lymphomas has recently increased markedly worldwide from about 1% to over 6% of primary intracranial neoplasms due mainly as a consequence of the AIDS epidemic.  Primary CNS lymphomas affect all ages, with a peak incidence in immunocompetent subjects during the sixth and seventh decade of life and a male:female ratio of 3:2. In immunocompromised patients, the age at manifestation is lowest in individuals who have an inherited immunodeficiency (10 years), followed by transplant recipients (37 years) and AIDS patients (39 years, 90% males). About 60% of primary CNS lymphomas involve the supratentorial space, including the frontal (15%), temporal (8%), parietal (7%) and occipital (3%) lobes, basal ganglia/periventricular regions (10%) and corpus callosum (5%), the posterior fossa (13%), and the spinal cord (1%).  The majority of primary CNS lymphomas are large B-cell lymphomas, often associated with the Epstein-Barr virus.  (Adapted from WHO.) Primary Myelofibrosis                                                             A progressive, chronic disease in which the bone marrow is replaced by fibrous tissue and blood is made in organs such as the liver and the spleen, instead of in the bone marrow. This disease is marked by an enlarged spleen and progressive anemia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Prostate Adenocarcinoma                                                           An adenocarcinoma arising from the prostate gland.  It is one of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men.  The majority of adenocarcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occurs in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland.  Grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma predicts disease progression and correlates with survival.  Several grading systems have been proposed, of which the Gleason system is the most commonly used.  Gleason sums of 2 to 4 represent well-differentiated disease, 5 to 7 moderately differentiated disease and 8 to 10 poorly differentiated disease.  Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Treatment options include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen ablation and cryotherapy.  Watchful waiting or surveillance alone is an option for older patients with low-grade or low-stage disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Prostate Carcinoma                                                                One of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men.  The majority of carcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occur in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland.  Grossly, prostatic carcinomas appear as ill-defined yellow areas of discoloration in the prostate gland lobes.  Adenocarcinomas represent the overwhelming majority of prostatic carcinomas.  Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic carcinoma.

Salivary Gland Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma                                           An adenoid cystic carcinoma arising from the salivary gland.  It is characterized by the presence of epithelial and myoepithelial cells forming tubular, cribriform, and solid patterns.  It usually presents as a slow growing mass.  Patients may experience pain because of the tumor propensity for perineural invasion.  The tumor may follow an aggressive clinical course with recurrences and mestastases to distant sites including lungs, bones, brain, and liver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Sarcoma                                                                           A usually aggressive malignant neoplasm of the soft tissue or bone. It arises from muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. Sarcomas occur in both children and adults. The prognosis depends largely on the degree of differentiation (grade) of the neoplasm. Representative subtypes are liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Schwannoma                                                                        A tumor of the peripheral nervous system that arises in the nerve sheath (protective covering).  It is almost always benign, but rare malignant schwannomas have been reported.

Sinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                 A rare, keratinizing or non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma arising from the mucosal epithelium of the nasal cavity or the paranasal sinuses.  It affects most often the maxillary sinus.  Less frequently, it arises from the nasal cavity, ethmoid sinus, sphenoid sinus, and frontal sinus.  Symptoms include nasal fullness, epistaxis, rhinorhea, pain, and paresthesia.  Patients with nasal squamous cell carcinoma usually present earlier than patients with maxillary sinus carcinoma and have a better prognosis compared to the latter group.

Teratoma                                                                          A type of germ cell tumor that may contain several different types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, and bone.  Teratomas occur most often in the ovaries in women, the testicles in men, and the tailbone in children.  Not all teratomas are malignant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Testicular Embryonal Carcinoma                                                    A malignant germ cell neoplasm arising from the testis.  It is composed of primitive epithelial cells arranged in solid, papillary, and glandular configurations.  Most patients present with a testicular mass, which may be associated with pain.  More than half of the patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis.  The form of treatment following radical orchiectomy is stage dependent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Thyroid Gland Anaplastic Carcinoma                                                An aggressive carcinoma of the thyroid gland composed of undifferentiated cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Thyroid Gland Carcinoma                                                           Cancer that forms in the thyroid gland (an organ at the base of the throat that makes hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and weight). Four main types of thyroid cancer are papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. The four types are based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Thyroid Gland Noninvasive Follicular Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear FeaturesA non-invasive neoplasm of thyroid follicular cells with a follicular growth pattern and nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma that has an extremely low malignant potential. These tumors were formerly classified as non-invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma or well-differentiated tumor of uncertain malignant potential.

Ovary                                The pair of female reproductive glands in which the ova, or eggs, are formed. The ovaries are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Pancreas                             An organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is the shape of a fish and about the size of a hand. It is a compound gland composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues. The endocrine pancreas makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for energy. The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose.

molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

                                                 A molecular genetic technique that isolates and sequences chromosomal regions that are rich in open chromatin. First, nuclei are harvested from a cellular sample. Then a hyperactive Tn5 transposase is added to the nuclei where it excises non-nucleosomal DNA strands and ligates co-administered high-throughput sequencing adapters (tagmentation).  The tagged DNA fragments are isolated, amplified by PCR and sequenced. The number of reads for specific region of DNA correlate with increased chromatin accessibility and this method can identify regions of transcription factor and nucleosome binding.

Amplicon Sequencing                                                A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Bisulfite Sequencing                                               A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

It is assumed that these proteins are related to the function of the target antigen at the cellular level.

Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation High-throughput Sequencing       A molecular biology method combining crosslinking-immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing techniques to detect and map RNA-protein interactions. In CLIP, whole tissues, organisms or individual cell types are treated with UV irradiation, which introduces covalent bonds between RNA-protein complexes. This is followed by immunoprecipitation and removal of the protein component of the crosslinked complex.

DRIP-seq                                                           A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Dynamic Light Scattering                                           A type of spectroscopy that utilizes a laser beam to irradiate a sample containing particles in suspension, resulting in light scattering. Rapid fluctuations in scattering intensity, around a mean value at a certain angle, occur because of particle diffusion and are dependent upon on particle size. The calculated correlation function yields a diffusion coefficient, for a given temperature and viscosity, which can be used to calculate particle size.

HL-Chip                                                            A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Immunohistochemistry Staining Method                               Immunohistochemical staining techniques allow for the visualization of antigens via the sequential application of a specific antibody to the antigen (primary antibody), a secondary antibody to the primary antibody and an enzyme complex with a chromogenic substrate. The enzymatic activation of the chromogen results in a visible reaction product at the antigen site. The specimen may then be counterstained and coverslipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope and aid in the differential diagnosis of pathophysiological processes, which may or may not be associated with a particular antigen.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Mint-ChIP                                                          A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing.

It is the underlying principle of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Optical Coherence Tomography                                       Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) combines the principles of ultrasound with the imaging performance of a microscope. OCT uses infrared light waves that reflect off the internal microstructure within the biological tissues. The frequencies and bandwidths of infrared light are orders of magnitude higher than medical ultrasound signals, resulting in greatly increased image resolution, 8-25 times greater than any existing modality. In addition to providing high-level resolutions for the evaluation of microanatomic structures OCT is also able to provide information regarding tissue composition.

A sample is prepared and then exposed to primary antibodies raised in different species recognizing the target epitopes on the proteins of interest. Then, secondary antibodies that are tagged with short oligonucleotides and that target each primary antibody are added. Next, a mixture comprised of a ligase, PCR components and a connector oligonucleotide, which hybridizes to both oligonucleotide tags and can prime rolling DNA circle synthesis, are added and the sample is subjected to real-time PCR to amplify the DNA circles. Rolling circle synthesis and amplification is only possible if the protein epitopes are in close proximity (i.e. in a protein complex). Finally, a labeled complementary nucleotide probe is added to detect and/or visualize the amplified DNA.

RAS Protein Family Activation Assay                                An in vitro assay that can indirectly detect the activation of small GTPases in the RAS family through the staining of phosphorylated forms of MEK (MAP2K) family proteins (pMEK). A farnesylated RAS family protein is anchored to an in vitro model of the plasma membrane and, under different conditions, is co-incubated with both a RAF family protein, which binds to and is activated by active RAS proteins, and a MEK family protein, which is phosphorylated by active RAF proteins. pMEK is detected using a donor bead coated with anti-MEK antibodies that is capable of oxidizing an acceptor molecule attached to an anti-pMEK antibody. When the donor and acceptor are in close proximity, the acceptor molecule is oxidized and can be visualized using electron microscopy.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing.

Arises from the low probability absorption of quanta with a higher energy than that required for a transition: the difference in energy is emitted as a lower frequency (energy) photon.

Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing                        A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Single-Cell Barcode Chip                                           A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TCR Sequencing                                                     A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Thermal Shift Assay                                                A molecular biology technique used to detect the interaction of a DNA binding protein with its cognate binding sequence.  Labeled DNAs were reacted with crude cell extracts and the complexes are run through a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel.  The migration of the labeled DNA through the gel will be slower by being bound.  This shift in electrophoretic mobility indicates functional binding between the protein and the DNA.

Suspended Microchannel Resonator                                   Particles are weighed in real-time with the suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) as they flow through a hollow cantilever. In addition to weighing particles with femtogram precision, the SMR can also measure mass density with a resolution of 10-4 g/mL. This is possible since the microchannel resonant frequency is determined by the difference in mass of the particle with respect to that of the displaced fluid. Thus, the particle's density is determined by measuring its mass in two fluids of different densities. The SMR can measure the growth of single cells as well as the absorption of biomolecules to microchannel walls. Scaling the current SMR design by ten-fold will result in a thousand-fold improvement in mass resolution (attogram) and thereby enable single viruses to be weighed with high precision.

Pancreas                             An organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is the shape of a fish and about the size of a hand. It is a compound gland composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues. The endocrine pancreas makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for energy. The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known. Pelvic Lymph Nodes                   Any lymph node within the pelvic region.

Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor                                                  An aggressive malignant embryonal neoplasm arising from the central nervous system. It is composed of cells with a large eccentric nucleus, prominent nucleolus, and abundant cytoplasm. Mutations of the SMARCB1 gene or very rarely SMARCA4 (BRG1) gene are present. The vast majority of cases occur in childhood. Symptoms include lethargy, vomiting, cranial nerve palsy, headache, and hemiplegia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia                                                    The most frequent type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Approximately 75% of cases occur in children under six years of age.  This is a good prognosis leukemia.  In the pediatric age group the complete remission rate is approximately 95% and the disease free survival rate is 70%.  Approximately 80% of children appear to be cured.

It includes the most frequently seen morphologic variants which are: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Barrett Esophagus                                                                 Esophageal lesion lined with columnar metaplastic epithelium which is flat or villiform. Barrett epithelium is characterized by two different types of cells: goblet cells and columnar cells. The symptomatology of Barrett esophagus is that of gastro-esophageal reflux. It is the precursor of most esophageal adenocarcinomas.

The basal cell neoplastic proliferation in the epidermis results in basal cell carcinomas.  The basal cell neoplastic proliferation in the salivary glands can be benign, resulting in basal cell adenomas or malignant, resulting in basal cell adenocarcinomas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Basal-Like Breast Carcinoma                                                       A biologic subset of breast carcinoma defined by high expression of genes characteristic of basal epithelial cells, including KRT5 and KRT17, annexin 8, CX3CL1, and TRIM29, and usually by lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It is the most common subtype of breast cancer associated with BRCA1 mutations, and is associated with a poor prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Biliary Tract Carcinoma                                                           A carcinoma arising from the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, cystic duct, or gallbladder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bladder Carcinoma                                                                 Cancer that forms in tissues of the bladder (the organ that stores urine). Most bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas (cancer that begins in cells that normally make up the inner lining of the bladder). Other types include squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in thin, flat cells) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). The cells that form squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma develop in the inner lining of the bladder as a result of chronic irritation and inflammation.

Cervical Carcinoma                                                                Cancer that forms in tissues of the cervix (the organ connecting the uterus and vagina). It is usually a slow-growing cancer that may not have symptoms but can be found with regular Pap tests (a procedure in which cells are scraped from the cervix and looked at under a microscope). Cervical cancer is almost always caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

Cancer that forms where the right and left ducts meet is called Klatskin tumor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Chondroblastoma                                                                   A benign, chondroid-producing, well-circumscribed, lytic neoplasm usually arising from the epiphysis of long bones.  It is characterized by the presence of chondroblasts, osteoclast-like giant cells, chondroid formation, calcification, and mitotic activity. In aggressive cases, there is rearrangement of the 8q21 chromosome band.  It occurs most frequently in children and young adults and rarely metastasizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Choriocarcinoma                                                                   An aggressive malignant tumor arising from trophoblastic cells. The vast majority of cases arise in the uterus and represent gestational choriocarcinomas that derive from placental trophoblastic cells. Approximately half of the cases develop from a complete hydatidiform mole. A minority of cases arise in the testis or the ovaries. There is often marked elevation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood. Choriocarcinomas disseminate rapidly through the hematogenous route; the lungs are most frequently affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia                                                      The most common type of chronic lymphoid leukemia.  It comprises 90% of chronic lymphoid leukemias in the United States.  Morphologically, the neoplastic cells are small, round B-lymphocytes.  This type of leukemia is not considered to be curable with available therapy.

Representative examples of benign neoplasms include lipoma and leiomyoma.  Representative examples of malignant neoplasms include carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma.  Colorectal adenomas always exhibit epithelial dysplasia and are considered premalignant neoplasms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Combined Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma                          A rare tumor containing unequivocal elements of both hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma that are intimately admixed.  This tumor should be distinguished from separate hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma arising in the same liver.  The prognosis of this tumor is poor.

Other symptoms include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. There are several subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ                                                   A noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, ductal carcinoma in situ may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues, although it is not known at this time how to predict which lesions will become invasive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Neoplasm                                         A neoplasm of the nervous system that arises from the neuroepithelial tissues.  Representative examples include astrocytic tumors, oligodendroglial tumors, ependymal tumors, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Endometrial Carcinoma                                                             Cancer that forms in the tissue lining the uterus (the small, hollow, pear-shaped organ in a woman's pelvis in which a fetus develops). Most endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Endometrial Neoplasm                                                              A benign, borderline, or malignant neoplasm that affects the endometrium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Ependymoma                                                                        A type of brain tumor that begins in cells lining the spinal cord central canal (fluid-filled space down the center) or the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces of the brain). Ependymomas may also form in the choroid plexus (tissue in the ventricles that makes cerebrospinal fluid).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Esophageal Adenocarcinoma                                                         A malignant tumor with glandular differentiation arising predominantly from Barrett mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus.  Rare examples of esophageal adenocarcinoma deriving from ectopic gastric mucosa in the upper esophagus have also been reported.  Grossly, esophageal adenocarcinomas are similar to esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.  Microscopically, adenocarcinomas arising in the setting of Barrett esophagus are typically papillary and/or tubular.  The prognosis is poor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Esophageal Carcinoma                                                              Cancer that forms in tissues lining the esophagus (the muscular tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach). Two types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in flat cells lining the esophagus) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                A squamous cell carcinoma arising from the esophagus.  It is associated with a long history of tobacco and alcohol abuse and is exceedingly rare before the age of 30.  The median age is around 65 in both males and females.  It is located mostly in the middle and lower third of the esophagus.  Grossly, polypoid, ulcerated, plaque-like and occult lesions have been described.  The microscopic features are the same as in other squamous cell carcinomas.  Any degree of differentiation may occur, and variation within a single tumor is common.  The prognosis is poor.

Gallbladder Carcinoma                                                             Cancer that forms in tissues of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ below the liver that collects and stores bile (a fluid made by the liver to digest fat). Gallbladder cancer begins in the innermost layer of tissue and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gastric Adenocarcinoma                                                            An adenocarcinoma arising from the stomach glandular epithelium. Gastric adenocarcinoma is primarily a disease of older individuals.  It most commonly develops after a long period of atrophic gastritis and is strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. The lack of early symptoms often delays the diagnosis of gastric cancer. The majority of patients present with advanced tumors which have poor rates of curability. Microscopically, two important histologic types of gastric adenocarcinoma are recognized: the intestinal and diffuse type. The overall prognosis of gastric adenocarcinomas is poor, even in patients who receive a \"curative\" resection (adapted from Sternberg's Surgical Pathology, 3rd ed., 1999).

The category of adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction also includes the majority of adenocarcinomas previously called gastric cardia adenocarcinomas.  Squamous cell carcinomas that affect or cross the junction of the stomach and esophagus are classified as carcinomas of the distal esophagus.  Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction occurs more often in Caucasian middle aged and elderly males.  Clinical signs and symptoms include dysphagia, abdominal pain, and weight loss.  The prognosis depends on the completeness of the surgical resection, the number of lymph nodes involved by cancer, and the presence or absence of postoperative complications.  The presence of TP53 mutations indicates worse prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Gastrointestinal Stromal Neoplasm                                                 A type of tumor that usually begins in cells in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract.

This subtype of breast cancer is associated with a good prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Lung Adenocarcinoma                                                               A carcinoma that arises from the lung and is characterized by the presence of malignant glandular epithelial cells.  There is a male predilection with a male to female ratio of 2:1.  Usually lung adenocarcinoma is asymptomatic and is identified through screening studies or as an incidental radiologic finding.  If clinical symptoms are present they include shortness of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and fever.  Tobacco smoke is a known risk factor.

Lung Small Cell Carcinoma                                                         An aggressive (fast-growing) cancer that forms in tissues of the lung and can spread to other parts of the body. The cancer cells look small and oval-shaped when looked at under a microscope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                      A carcinoma arising from squamous bronchial epithelial cells. It may be keratinizing or non-keratinizing. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the presence of keratinization, pearl formation, and/or intercellular bridges. Non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the absence of keratinization, pearl formation, and intercellular bridges. Cigarette smoking and arsenic exposure are strongly associated with squamous cell lung carcinoma.

Lymphoma                                                                          Cancer that begins in cells of the immune system. There are two basic categories of lymphomas. One kind is Hodgkin lymphoma, which is marked by the presence of a type of cell called the Reed-Sternberg cell. The other category is non-Hodgkin lymphomas, which includes a large, diverse group of cancers of immune system cells. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas can be further divided into cancers that have an indolent (slow-growing) course and those that have an aggressive (fast-growing) course. These subtypes behave and respond to treatment differently. Both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas can occur in children and adults, and prognosis and treatment depend on the stage and the type of cancer.

Representative examples include carcinoma and lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor                                           An uncommon, highly aggressive malignant tumor, arising from the peripheral nerves and affecting mostly adults in their third to sixth decades of life.  It usually occurs in medium-sized and large nerves of the buttock, thigh, upper arm, or the paraspinal region.  It may be associated with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Malignant Peritoneal Neoplasm                                                     Cancer of the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Malignant Skin Neoplasm                                                           Cancer that forms in the tissues of the skin. There are several types of skin cancer. Skin cancer that forms in melanocytes (skin cells that make pigment) is called melanoma. Skin cancer that forms in the lower part of the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) is called basal cell carcinoma. Skin cancer that forms in squamous cells (flat cells that form the surface of the skin) is called squamous cell carcinoma. Skin cancer that forms in neuroendocrine cells (cells that release hormones in response to signals from the nervous system) is called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Most skin cancers form in older people on parts of the body exposed to the sun or in people who have weakened immune systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mantle Cell Lymphoma                                                              An aggressive, usually diffuse non-Hodgkin lymphoma composed of small to medium sized B-lymphocytes (centrocytes).  Most patients present with advanced stage disease with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow involvement.  The gastrointestinal tract is the most commonly affected extranodal site by this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  The vast majority of cases express the t(11;14)(q13;q32) resulting in the rearrangement of the BCL-1 gene and the overexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Marginal Zone Lymphoma                                                            An indolent (slow-growing) type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins forming in certain areas (the marginal zones) of lymph tissue. There are three types based on whether it forms in the spleen, lymph nodes, or other lymphoid tissue that contains a lot of B cells (a type of white blood cell).

Melanoma                                                                          A malignant, usually aggressive tumor composed of atypical, neoplastic melanocytes. Most often, melanomas arise in the skin (cutaneous melanomas) and include the following histologic subtypes: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma. Cutaneous melanomas may arise from acquired or congenital melanocytic or dysplastic nevi. Melanomas may also arise in other anatomic sites including the gastrointestinal system, eye, urinary tract, and reproductive system. Melanomas frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and brain.

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma                                                  An infiltrating adenocarcinoma that arises from the epithelial cells of the pancreas.  It affects males more often than females and the patients are usually over 50 years of age.  Microscopically it is characterized by the presence of glandular (ductal) differentiation and desmoplastic stroma formation.  Signs and symptoms include pain, loss of weight, and jaundice.  It grows rapidly and is usually detected after it has metastasized to other anatomic sites.  The prognosis is usually poor.

The tumor can be hormonally functioning or not. It has a low frequency of metastatic spread. When metastatic, the term metastatic pituitary neuroendocrine tumor is endorsed instead of pituitary carcinoma.

It usually arises from the skin or subcutaneous tissues in the extremities, trunk, and head and neck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia                                           The most frequent type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Approximately 75% of cases occur in children under six years of age.  This is a good prognosis leukemia.  In the pediatric age group the complete remission rate is approximately 95% and the disease free survival rate is 70%.  Approximately 80% of children appear to be cured.  In the adult age group the complete remission rate is 60-85%.

They should be differentiated from secondary involvement of the nervous system in systemic lymphomas. The incidence of primary CNS lymphomas has recently increased markedly worldwide from about 1% to over 6% of primary intracranial neoplasms due mainly as a consequence of the AIDS epidemic.  Primary CNS lymphomas affect all ages, with a peak incidence in immunocompetent subjects during the sixth and seventh decade of life and a male:female ratio of 3:2. In immunocompromised patients, the age at manifestation is lowest in individuals who have an inherited immunodeficiency (10 years), followed by transplant recipients (37 years) and AIDS patients (39 years, 90% males). About 60% of primary CNS lymphomas involve the supratentorial space, including the frontal (15%), temporal (8%), parietal (7%) and occipital (3%) lobes, basal ganglia/periventricular regions (10%) and corpus callosum (5%), the posterior fossa (13%), and the spinal cord (1%).  The majority of primary CNS lymphomas are large B-cell lymphomas, often associated with the Epstein-Barr virus.  (Adapted from WHO.) Primary Myelofibrosis                                                             A progressive, chronic disease in which the bone marrow is replaced by fibrous tissue and blood is made in organs such as the liver and the spleen, instead of in the bone marrow. This disease is marked by an enlarged spleen and progressive anemia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Prostate Adenocarcinoma                                                           An adenocarcinoma arising from the prostate gland.  It is one of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men.  The majority of adenocarcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occurs in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland.  Grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma predicts disease progression and correlates with survival.  Several grading systems have been proposed, of which the Gleason system is the most commonly used.  Gleason sums of 2 to 4 represent well-differentiated disease, 5 to 7 moderately differentiated disease and 8 to 10 poorly differentiated disease.  Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Treatment options include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen ablation and cryotherapy.  Watchful waiting or surveillance alone is an option for older patients with low-grade or low-stage disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Prostate Carcinoma                                                                One of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men.  The majority of carcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occur in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland.  Grossly, prostatic carcinomas appear as ill-defined yellow areas of discoloration in the prostate gland lobes.  Adenocarcinomas represent the overwhelming majority of prostatic carcinomas.  Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic carcinoma.

Salivary Gland Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma                                           An adenoid cystic carcinoma arising from the salivary gland.  It is characterized by the presence of epithelial and myoepithelial cells forming tubular, cribriform, and solid patterns.  It usually presents as a slow growing mass.  Patients may experience pain because of the tumor propensity for perineural invasion.  The tumor may follow an aggressive clinical course with recurrences and mestastases to distant sites including lungs, bones, brain, and liver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Sarcoma                                                                           A usually aggressive malignant neoplasm of the soft tissue or bone. It arises from muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. Sarcomas occur in both children and adults. The prognosis depends largely on the degree of differentiation (grade) of the neoplasm. Representative subtypes are liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Schwannoma                                                                        A tumor of the peripheral nervous system that arises in the nerve sheath (protective covering).  It is almost always benign, but rare malignant schwannomas have been reported.

Sinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                 A rare, keratinizing or non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma arising from the mucosal epithelium of the nasal cavity or the paranasal sinuses.  It affects most often the maxillary sinus.  Less frequently, it arises from the nasal cavity, ethmoid sinus, sphenoid sinus, and frontal sinus.  Symptoms include nasal fullness, epistaxis, rhinorhea, pain, and paresthesia.  Patients with nasal squamous cell carcinoma usually present earlier than patients with maxillary sinus carcinoma and have a better prognosis compared to the latter group.

Teratoma                                                                          A type of germ cell tumor that may contain several different types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, and bone.  Teratomas occur most often in the ovaries in women, the testicles in men, and the tailbone in children.  Not all teratomas are malignant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Testicular Embryonal Carcinoma                                                    A malignant germ cell neoplasm arising from the testis.  It is composed of primitive epithelial cells arranged in solid, papillary, and glandular configurations.  Most patients present with a testicular mass, which may be associated with pain.  More than half of the patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis.  The form of treatment following radical orchiectomy is stage dependent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Thyroid Gland Anaplastic Carcinoma                                                An aggressive carcinoma of the thyroid gland composed of undifferentiated cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Thyroid Gland Carcinoma                                                           Cancer that forms in the thyroid gland (an organ at the base of the throat that makes hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and weight). Four main types of thyroid cancer are papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. The four types are based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Thyroid Gland Noninvasive Follicular Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear FeaturesA non-invasive neoplasm of thyroid follicular cells with a follicular growth pattern and nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma that has an extremely low malignant potential. These tumors were formerly classified as non-invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma or well-differentiated tumor of uncertain malignant potential.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

                                                 A molecular genetic technique that isolates and sequences chromosomal regions that are rich in open chromatin. First, nuclei are harvested from a cellular sample. Then a hyperactive Tn5 transposase is added to the nuclei where it excises non-nucleosomal DNA strands and ligates co-administered high-throughput sequencing adapters (tagmentation).  The tagged DNA fragments are isolated, amplified by PCR and sequenced. The number of reads for specific region of DNA correlate with increased chromatin accessibility and this method can identify regions of transcription factor and nucleosome binding.

Amplicon Sequencing                                                A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Bisulfite Sequencing                                               A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

It is assumed that these proteins are related to the function of the target antigen at the cellular level.

Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation High-throughput Sequencing       A molecular biology method combining crosslinking-immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing techniques to detect and map RNA-protein interactions. In CLIP, whole tissues, organisms or individual cell types are treated with UV irradiation, which introduces covalent bonds between RNA-protein complexes. This is followed by immunoprecipitation and removal of the protein component of the crosslinked complex.

DRIP-seq                                                           A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Dynamic Light Scattering                                           A type of spectroscopy that utilizes a laser beam to irradiate a sample containing particles in suspension, resulting in light scattering. Rapid fluctuations in scattering intensity, around a mean value at a certain angle, occur because of particle diffusion and are dependent upon on particle size. The calculated correlation function yields a diffusion coefficient, for a given temperature and viscosity, which can be used to calculate particle size.

HL-Chip                                                            A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Immunohistochemistry Staining Method                               Immunohistochemical staining techniques allow for the visualization of antigens via the sequential application of a specific antibody to the antigen (primary antibody), a secondary antibody to the primary antibody and an enzyme complex with a chromogenic substrate. The enzymatic activation of the chromogen results in a visible reaction product at the antigen site. The specimen may then be counterstained and coverslipped. Results are interpreted using a light microscope and aid in the differential diagnosis of pathophysiological processes, which may or may not be associated with a particular antigen.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Mint-ChIP                                                          A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing.

It is the underlying principle of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Optical Coherence Tomography                                       Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) combines the principles of ultrasound with the imaging performance of a microscope. OCT uses infrared light waves that reflect off the internal microstructure within the biological tissues. The frequencies and bandwidths of infrared light are orders of magnitude higher than medical ultrasound signals, resulting in greatly increased image resolution, 8-25 times greater than any existing modality. In addition to providing high-level resolutions for the evaluation of microanatomic structures OCT is also able to provide information regarding tissue composition.

A sample is prepared and then exposed to primary antibodies raised in different species recognizing the target epitopes on the proteins of interest. Then, secondary antibodies that are tagged with short oligonucleotides and that target each primary antibody are added. Next, a mixture comprised of a ligase, PCR components and a connector oligonucleotide, which hybridizes to both oligonucleotide tags and can prime rolling DNA circle synthesis, are added and the sample is subjected to real-time PCR to amplify the DNA circles. Rolling circle synthesis and amplification is only possible if the protein epitopes are in close proximity (i.e. in a protein complex). Finally, a labeled complementary nucleotide probe is added to detect and/or visualize the amplified DNA.

RAS Protein Family Activation Assay                                An in vitro assay that can indirectly detect the activation of small GTPases in the RAS family through the staining of phosphorylated forms of MEK (MAP2K) family proteins (pMEK). A farnesylated RAS family protein is anchored to an in vitro model of the plasma membrane and, under different conditions, is co-incubated with both a RAF family protein, which binds to and is activated by active RAS proteins, and a MEK family protein, which is phosphorylated by active RAF proteins. pMEK is detected using a donor bead coated with anti-MEK antibodies that is capable of oxidizing an acceptor molecule attached to an anti-pMEK antibody. When the donor and acceptor are in close proximity, the acceptor molecule is oxidized and can be visualized using electron microscopy.

First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing.

Arises from the low probability absorption of quanta with a higher energy than that required for a transition: the difference in energy is emitted as a lower frequency (energy) photon.

Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing                        A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Single-Cell Barcode Chip                                           A molecular genetic technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to map the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins in a sample of cells. First, crosslinked protein-DNA complexes are isolated using ChIP. Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.

Next, the crosslinks are broken, the proteins are removed and the purified DNA is modified with adaptor oligonucleotides to facilitate massively parallel DNA sequencing. Following sequencing, the DNA sequences that are obtained can be mapped to their genomic locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       TCR Sequencing                                                     A DNA sequencing technique that can differentiate cytosine from 5-methylcytosine in a DNA sample. First, a denatured DNA sample is treated with bisulfite which converts non-methylated cytosine to uracil. Next, the sample is amplified using a PCR method that does not discriminate between non-methylated and methylated sequences. The amplified DNA is subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The resulting sequence is compared to an identical control sample of DNA that was not treated with bisulfite. Unmethylated cytosines will be displayed as cytosines in the control sample and as thymines in the bisulfite-treated sample.

Thermal Shift Assay                                                A molecular biology technique used to detect the interaction of a DNA binding protein with its cognate binding sequence.  Labeled DNAs were reacted with crude cell extracts and the complexes are run through a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel.  The migration of the labeled DNA through the gel will be slower by being bound.  This shift in electrophoretic mobility indicates functional binding between the protein and the DNA.

Suspended Microchannel Resonator                                   Particles are weighed in real-time with the suspended microchannel resonator (SMR) as they flow through a hollow cantilever. In addition to weighing particles with femtogram precision, the SMR can also measure mass density with a resolution of 10-4 g/mL. This is possible since the microchannel resonant frequency is determined by the difference in mass of the particle with respect to that of the displaced fluid. Thus, the particle's density is determined by measuring its mass in two fluids of different densities. The SMR can measure the growth of single cells as well as the absorption of biomolecules to microchannel walls. Scaling the current SMR design by ten-fold will result in a thousand-fold improvement in mass resolution (attogram) and thereby enable single viruses to be weighed with high precision.

Pancreas                             An organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is the shape of a fish and about the size of a hand. It is a compound gland composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues. The endocrine pancreas makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for energy. The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food. Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans. The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known. Pelvic Lymph Nodes                   Any lymph node within the pelvic region.

It is composed of cells with a large eccentric nucleus, prominent nucleolus, and abundant cytoplasm. Mutations of the SMARCB1 gene or very rarely SMARCA4 (BRG1) gene are present. The vast majority of cases occur in childhood. Symptoms include lethargy, vomiting, cranial nerve palsy, headache, and hemiplegia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         B Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia                                                    The most frequent type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Approximately 75% of cases occur in children under six years of age.  This is a good prognosis leukemia.  In the pediatric age group the complete remission rate is approximately 95% and the disease free survival rate is 70%.  Approximately 80% of children appear to be cured.  In the adult age group the complete remission rate is 60-85%.

It includes the most frequently seen morphologic variants which are: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Barrett Esophagus                                                                 Esophageal lesion lined with columnar metaplastic epithelium which is flat or villiform. Barrett epithelium is characterized by two different types of cells: goblet cells and columnar cells. The symptomatology of Barrett esophagus is that of gastro-esophageal reflux. It is the precursor of most esophageal adenocarcinomas.

The basal cell neoplastic proliferation in the epidermis results in basal cell carcinomas.  The basal cell neoplastic proliferation in the salivary glands can be benign, resulting in basal cell adenomas or malignant, resulting in basal cell adenocarcinomas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Basal-Like Breast Carcinoma                                                       A biologic subset of breast carcinoma defined by high expression of genes characteristic of basal epithelial cells, including KRT5 and KRT17, annexin 8, CX3CL1, and TRIM29, and usually by lack of expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). It is the most common subtype of breast cancer associated with BRCA1 mutations, and is associated with a poor prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Biliary Tract Carcinoma                                                           A carcinoma arising from the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, cystic duct, or gallbladder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bladder Carcinoma                                                                 Cancer that forms in tissues of the bladder (the organ that stores urine). Most bladder cancers are transitional cell carcinomas (cancer that begins in cells that normally make up the inner lining of the bladder). Other types include squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in thin, flat cells) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). The cells that form squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma develop in the inner lining of the bladder as a result of chronic irritation and inflammation.

Cervical Carcinoma                                                                Cancer that forms in tissues of the cervix (the organ connecting the uterus and vagina). It is usually a slow-growing cancer that may not have symptoms but can be found with regular Pap tests (a procedure in which cells are scraped from the cervix and looked at under a microscope). Cervical cancer is almost always caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

Cancer that forms where the right and left ducts meet is called Klatskin tumor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Chondroblastoma                                                                   A benign, chondroid-producing, well-circumscribed, lytic neoplasm usually arising from the epiphysis of long bones.  It is characterized by the presence of chondroblasts, osteoclast-like giant cells, chondroid formation, calcification, and mitotic activity. In aggressive cases, there is rearrangement of the 8q21 chromosome band.  It occurs most frequently in children and young adults and rarely metastasizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Choriocarcinoma                                                                   An aggressive malignant tumor arising from trophoblastic cells. The vast majority of cases arise in the uterus and represent gestational choriocarcinomas that derive from placental trophoblastic cells. Approximately half of the cases develop from a complete hydatidiform mole. A minority of cases arise in the testis or the ovaries. There is often marked elevation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood. Choriocarcinomas disseminate rapidly through the hematogenous route; the lungs are most frequently affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia                                                      The most common type of chronic lymphoid leukemia.  It comprises 90% of chronic lymphoid leukemias in the United States.  Morphologically, the neoplastic cells are small, round B-lymphocytes.  This type of leukemia is not considered to be curable with available therapy.

Representative examples of benign neoplasms include lipoma and leiomyoma.  Representative examples of malignant neoplasms include carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma.  Colorectal adenomas always exhibit epithelial dysplasia and are considered premalignant neoplasms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Combined Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma                          A rare tumor containing unequivocal elements of both hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma that are intimately admixed.  This tumor should be distinguished from separate hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma arising in the same liver.  The prognosis of this tumor is poor.

Other symptoms include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. There are several subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ductal Breast Carcinoma In Situ                                                   A noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, ductal carcinoma in situ may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues, although it is not known at this time how to predict which lesions will become invasive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Neoplasm                                         A neoplasm of the nervous system that arises from the neuroepithelial tissues.  Representative examples include astrocytic tumors, oligodendroglial tumors, ependymal tumors, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Endometrial Carcinoma                                                             Cancer that forms in the tissue lining the uterus (the small, hollow, pear-shaped organ in a woman's pelvis in which a fetus develops). Most endometrial cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Endometrial Neoplasm                                                              A benign, borderline, or malignant neoplasm that affects the endometrium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Ependymoma                                                                        A type of brain tumor that begins in cells lining the spinal cord central canal (fluid-filled space down the center) or the ventricles (fluid-filled spaces of the brain). Ependymomas may also form in the choroid plexus (tissue in the ventricles that makes cerebrospinal fluid).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Esophageal Adenocarcinoma                                                         A malignant tumor with glandular differentiation arising predominantly from Barrett mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus.  Rare examples of esophageal adenocarcinoma deriving from ectopic gastric mucosa in the upper esophagus have also been reported.  Grossly, esophageal adenocarcinomas are similar to esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.  Microscopically, adenocarcinomas arising in the setting of Barrett esophagus are typically papillary and/or tubular.  The prognosis is poor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Esophageal Carcinoma                                                              Cancer that forms in tissues lining the esophagus (the muscular tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach). Two types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in flat cells lining the esophagus) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                A squamous cell carcinoma arising from the esophagus.  It is associated with a long history of tobacco and alcohol abuse and is exceedingly rare before the age of 30.  The median age is around 65 in both males and females.  It is located mostly in the middle and lower third of the esophagus.  Grossly, polypoid, ulcerated, plaque-like and occult lesions have been described.  The microscopic features are the same as in other squamous cell carcinomas.  Any degree of differentiation may occur, and variation within a single tumor is common.  The prognosis is poor.

Gallbladder Carcinoma                                                             Cancer that forms in tissues of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ below the liver that collects and stores bile (a fluid made by the liver to digest fat). Gallbladder cancer begins in the innermost layer of tissue and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Gastric Adenocarcinoma                                                            An adenocarcinoma arising from the stomach glandular epithelium. Gastric adenocarcinoma is primarily a disease of older individuals.  It most commonly develops after a long period of atrophic gastritis and is strongly associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. The lack of early symptoms often delays the diagnosis of gastric cancer. The majority of patients present with advanced tumors which have poor rates of curability. Microscopically, two important histologic types of gastric adenocarcinoma are recognized: the intestinal and diffuse type. The overall prognosis of gastric adenocarcinomas is poor, even in patients who receive a \"curative\" resection (adapted from Sternberg's Surgical Pathology, 3rd ed., 1999).

The category of adenocarcinomas of the gastroesophageal junction also includes the majority of adenocarcinomas previously called gastric cardia adenocarcinomas.  Squamous cell carcinomas that affect or cross the junction of the stomach and esophagus are classified as carcinomas of the distal esophagus.  Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction occurs more often in Caucasian middle aged and elderly males.  Clinical signs and symptoms include dysphagia, abdominal pain, and weight loss.  The prognosis depends on the completeness of the surgical resection, the number of lymph nodes involved by cancer, and the presence or absence of postoperative complications.  The presence of TP53 mutations indicates worse prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Gastrointestinal Stromal Neoplasm                                                 A type of tumor that usually begins in cells in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract.

This subtype of breast cancer is associated with a good prognosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Lung Adenocarcinoma                                                               A carcinoma that arises from the lung and is characterized by the presence of malignant glandular epithelial cells.  There is a male predilection with a male to female ratio of 2:1.  Usually lung adenocarcinoma is asymptomatic and is identified through screening studies or as an incidental radiologic finding.  If clinical symptoms are present they include shortness of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and fever.  Tobacco smoke is a known risk factor.

Lung Small Cell Carcinoma                                                         An aggressive (fast-growing) cancer that forms in tissues of the lung and can spread to other parts of the body. The cancer cells look small and oval-shaped when looked at under a microscope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                      A carcinoma arising from squamous bronchial epithelial cells. It may be keratinizing or non-keratinizing. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the presence of keratinization, pearl formation, and/or intercellular bridges. Non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by the absence of keratinization, pearl formation, and intercellular bridges. Cigarette smoking and arsenic exposure are strongly associated with squamous cell lung carcinoma.

Lymphoma                                                                          Cancer that begins in cells of the immune system. There are two basic categories of lymphomas. One kind is Hodgkin lymphoma, which is marked by the presence of a type of cell called the Reed-Sternberg cell. The other category is non-Hodgkin lymphomas, which includes a large, diverse group of cancers of immune system cells. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas can be further divided into cancers that have an indolent (slow-growing) course and those that have an aggressive (fast-growing) course. These subtypes behave and respond to treatment differently. Both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas can occur in children and adults, and prognosis and treatment depend on the stage and the type of cancer.

Representative examples include carcinoma and lymphoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor                                           An uncommon, highly aggressive malignant tumor, arising from the peripheral nerves and affecting mostly adults in their third to sixth decades of life.  It usually occurs in medium-sized and large nerves of the buttock, thigh, upper arm, or the paraspinal region.  It may be associated with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Malignant Peritoneal Neoplasm                                                     Cancer of the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Malignant Skin Neoplasm                                                           Cancer that forms in the tissues of the skin. There are several types of skin cancer. Skin cancer that forms in melanocytes (skin cells that make pigment) is called melanoma. Skin cancer that forms in the lower part of the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) is called basal cell carcinoma. Skin cancer that forms in squamous cells (flat cells that form the surface of the skin) is called squamous cell carcinoma. Skin cancer that forms in neuroendocrine cells (cells that release hormones in response to signals from the nervous system) is called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Most skin cancers form in older people on parts of the body exposed to the sun or in people who have weakened immune systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Mantle Cell Lymphoma                                                              An aggressive, usually diffuse non-Hodgkin lymphoma composed of small to medium sized B-lymphocytes (centrocytes).  Most patients present with advanced stage disease with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow involvement.  The gastrointestinal tract is the most commonly affected extranodal site by this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  The vast majority of cases express the t(11;14)(q13;q32) resulting in the rearrangement of the BCL-1 gene and the overexpression of cyclin D1 mRNA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Marginal Zone Lymphoma                                                            An indolent (slow-growing) type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins forming in certain areas (the marginal zones) of lymph tissue. There are three types based on whether it forms in the spleen, lymph nodes, or other lymphoid tissue that contains a lot of B cells (a type of white blood cell).

Melanoma                                                                          A malignant, usually aggressive tumor composed of atypical, neoplastic melanocytes. Most often, melanomas arise in the skin (cutaneous melanomas) and include the following histologic subtypes: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma. Cutaneous melanomas may arise from acquired or congenital melanocytic or dysplastic nevi. Melanomas may also arise in other anatomic sites including the gastrointestinal system, eye, urinary tract, and reproductive system. Melanomas frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and brain.

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma                                                  An infiltrating adenocarcinoma that arises from the epithelial cells of the pancreas.  It affects males more often than females and the patients are usually over 50 years of age.  Microscopically it is characterized by the presence of glandular (ductal) differentiation and desmoplastic stroma formation.  Signs and symptoms include pain, loss of weight, and jaundice.  It grows rapidly and is usually detected after it has metastasized to other anatomic sites.  The prognosis is usually poor.

The tumor can be hormonally functioning or not. It has a low frequency of metastatic spread. When metastatic, the term metastatic pituitary neuroendocrine tumor is endorsed instead of pituitary carcinoma.

It usually arises from the skin or subcutaneous tissues in the extremities, trunk, and head and neck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia                                           The most frequent type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Approximately 75% of cases occur in children under six years of age.  This is a good prognosis leukemia.  In the pediatric age group the complete remission rate is approximately 95% and the disease free survival rate is 70%.  Approximately 80% of children appear to be cured.  In the adult age group the complete remission rate is 60-85%.

They should be differentiated from secondary involvement of the nervous system in systemic lymphomas. The incidence of primary CNS lymphomas has recently increased markedly worldwide from about 1% to over 6% of primary intracranial neoplasms due mainly as a consequence of the AIDS epidemic.  Primary CNS lymphomas affect all ages, with a peak incidence in immunocompetent subjects during the sixth and seventh decade of life and a male:female ratio of 3:2. In immunocompromised patients, the age at manifestation is lowest in individuals who have an inherited immunodeficiency (10 years), followed by transplant recipients (37 years) and AIDS patients (39 years, 90% males). About 60% of primary CNS lymphomas involve the supratentorial space, including the frontal (15%), temporal (8%), parietal (7%) and occipital (3%) lobes, basal ganglia/periventricular regions (10%) and corpus callosum (5%), the posterior fossa (13%), and the spinal cord (1%).  The majority of primary CNS lymphomas are large B-cell lymphomas, often associated with the Epstein-Barr virus.  (Adapted from WHO.) Primary Myelofibrosis                                                             A progressive, chronic disease in which the bone marrow is replaced by fibrous tissue and blood is made in organs such as the liver and the spleen, instead of in the bone marrow. This disease is marked by an enlarged spleen and progressive anemia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Prostate Adenocarcinoma                                                           An adenocarcinoma arising from the prostate gland.  It is one of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men.  The majority of adenocarcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occurs in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland.  Grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma predicts disease progression and correlates with survival.  Several grading systems have been proposed, of which the Gleason system is the most commonly used.  Gleason sums of 2 to 4 represent well-differentiated disease, 5 to 7 moderately differentiated disease and 8 to 10 poorly differentiated disease.  Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Treatment options include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen ablation and cryotherapy.  Watchful waiting or surveillance alone is an option for older patients with low-grade or low-stage disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Prostate Carcinoma                                                                One of the most common malignant tumors afflicting men.  The majority of carcinomas arise in the peripheral zone and a minority occur in the central or the transitional zone of the prostate gland.  Grossly, prostatic carcinomas appear as ill-defined yellow areas of discoloration in the prostate gland lobes.  Adenocarcinomas represent the overwhelming majority of prostatic carcinomas.  Prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) serum test is widely used as a screening test for the early detection of prostatic carcinoma.

Salivary Gland Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma                                           An adenoid cystic carcinoma arising from the salivary gland.  It is characterized by the presence of epithelial and myoepithelial cells forming tubular, cribriform, and solid patterns.  It usually presents as a slow growing mass.  Patients may experience pain because of the tumor propensity for perineural invasion.  The tumor may follow an aggressive clinical course with recurrences and mestastases to distant sites including lungs, bones, brain, and liver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Sarcoma                                                                           A usually aggressive malignant neoplasm of the soft tissue or bone. It arises from muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. Sarcomas occur in both children and adults. The prognosis depends largely on the degree of differentiation (grade) of the neoplasm. Representative subtypes are liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Schwannoma                                                                        A tumor of the peripheral nervous system that arises in the nerve sheath (protective covering).  It is almost always benign, but rare malignant schwannomas have been reported.

Sinonasal Squamous Cell Carcinoma                                                 A rare, keratinizing or non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma arising from the mucosal epithelium of the nasal cavity or the paranasal sinuses.  It affects most often the maxillary sinus.  Less frequently, it arises from the nasal cavity, ethmoid sinus, sphenoid sinus, and frontal sinus.  Symptoms include nasal fullness, epistaxis, rhinorhea, pain, and paresthesia.  Patients with nasal squamous cell carcinoma usually present earlier than patients with maxillary sinus carcinoma and have a better prognosis compared to the latter group.

Teratoma                                                                          A type of germ cell tumor that may contain several different types of tissue, such as hair, muscle, and bone.  Teratomas occur most often in the ovaries in women, the testicles in men, and the tailbone in children.  Not all teratomas are malignant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Testicular Embryonal Carcinoma                                                    A malignant germ cell neoplasm arising from the testis.  It is composed of primitive epithelial cells arranged in solid, papillary, and glandular configurations.  Most patients present with a testicular mass, which may be associated with pain.  More than half of the patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis.  The form of treatment following radical orchiectomy is stage dependent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Thyroid Gland Anaplastic Carcinoma                                                An aggressive carcinoma of the thyroid gland composed of undifferentiated cells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Thyroid Gland Carcinoma                                                           Cancer that forms in the thyroid gland (an organ at the base of the throat that makes hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and weight). Four main types of thyroid cancer are papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. The four types are based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Thyroid Gland Noninvasive Follicular Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear FeaturesA non-invasive neoplasm of thyroid follicular cells with a follicular growth pattern and nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma that has an extremely low malignant potential. These tumors were formerly classified as non-invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma or well-differentiated tumor of uncertain malignant potential.
